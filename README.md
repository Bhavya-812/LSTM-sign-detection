This is a LSTM-based model for sign language detection project effectively captures the temporal dependencies in hand gesture sequences, allowing for accurate recognition of sign language gestures in real-time. This project utilizes various scripts to collect data, preprocess it, train a deep learning model for sign language detection, and finally deploy the trained model in a real-time application for gesture recognition. Each script plays a crucial role in different stages of the project, contributing to the overall functionality of the sign language detection system.
